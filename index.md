# SketchUp Extension Help FAQ

## I installed an extension but I cannot find it?

- Make sure to read the description of the extension. Not all extensions have toolbars. Not all extension's menus appear under the Extension menu.

- Restart SketchUp. Some times SketchUp must be restarted for a newly installed extension to load correctly.

## Is the extension compatible with SketchUp version <???>?

- The extension page on [Extension Warehouse](https://extensions.sketchup.com/) will list the compatible versions of SketchUp for any extension.

- If you have a version newer than the newest listed, try the extension anyway, it could be that the extension info hasn't been updated to include the compatibility with the latest version yet.

- If the extension is marked as compatible with your version but you're seeing errors, [start a thread](#forums) describing your issue and see if the community can help you.

# Further Help

Best place to ask for help is one of the user forums for SketchUp. Asking your question there usually gers you an answer faster than what an email does. As a bonus, asking questions in forums allow for other people to find the answer to your question.

## How to ask a good question

- What SketchUp version are you using?
- What OS are you using?
- Are you seeing an error message, if so what does it say?
- What are you observing?
  - What are your actions when you run into the issue?
  - What is the expected behaviour?
